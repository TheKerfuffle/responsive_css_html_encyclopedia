# responsive_css_html_encyclopedia

This is an assigned test project done for the media junction front end development interview process.

Features of Note:
- No Javascript was used in the coding of this project.
- Reactive Dropdown menu that changes form and shape for Mobile and Desktop views.
    - Nested Dropdowns entirely coded with CSS.
    - Custom Hamburger Menu icon made using CSS.
    - Info dropdown actually links you to the part of the page it references.
- Sticky Header - for easier navigation throughout the page.
- Parallax Images - I have always been fascinated by this effect and wanted to find out how to do it!

This was one of the most fun projects I have ever done. I am so excited to apply the things I learned making this
to future and current projects. 

To say that I am a beginner with css would be an understatement. For much of my time coding, I have used css 
frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI. So what you are seeing displayed in this project are the forays of 
someone new leaping into unfamiliar territory. In these leaps I sought to emulate without replicating.

I would like to thank the youtuber FollowAndrew for his Reactive CSS-only dropdown menus. 
His videos made the dropdown menu you see in this project tick.

I also referenced W3 Schools and color-hex for various other things on display within this project.

This Project uses Font Awesome Icons. I did not create these nor do I hold any rights over them.
