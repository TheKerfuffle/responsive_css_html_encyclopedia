## responsive_css_html_encyclopedia

This is an assigned test project done for the media junction front end development interview process.

## Features of Note:

- No Javascript was used in the coding of this project.
- Reactive Dropdown menu that changes form and shape for Mobile and Desktop views.
    - Nested Dropdowns entirely coded with CSS.
    - Custom Hamburger Menu icon made using CSS.
    - Info dropdown actually links you to the part of the page it references.
- Sticky Header - for easier navigation throughout the page.
- Parallax Images - I have always been fascinated by this effect and wanted to find out how to do it!

## Reflections

To say that I am a beginner with CSS would be an understatement. For much of my time coding, I have used css 
frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI. So what you are seeing displayed in this project are the forays of 
someone new leaping into unfamiliar territory. I know that there is so much more for me to learn, for example 
one can find the ruins of CSS Grid classes within style.css that were abandoned out of frustration in favor of
Flex-Box which is more familiar to me.

This was one of the most fun projects I have ever done. I am so excited to apply the things I learned making this
to future and current projects. That said there is a lot here that I tried to fine-tune but feel there is still more to learn.
That is not to say that I'm disappointed, rather that I feel I have a lot of room to grow as it relates to Front-End development.

I can't wait to see how my CSS skills develop.

## References

I would like to thank the youtuber FollowAndrew for his Reactive CSS-only dropdown menus. 
His videos made the dropdown menu you see in this project tick.

I also referenced W3 Schools and color-hex for various other things on display within this project.

This Project uses Font Awesome Icons. I did not create these nor do I hold any rights over them.

## Original Project Prompt:

Here's that code test!  If you can get it to me by the end of the weekend, that'd be awesome, but I'll give you a full week, so due 8/12—but that's pretty arbitrary so let me know if you need more time because I know life gets busy.  Other than that let me know if you have any questions.  Good luck!

Encyclopedia Page Code Test
Your task is to create a responsive encyclopedia page.  The content can be anything (cats, quantum physics, toasters, anything—have fun with it or leave it all placeholder) but the layout must resemble the attached example.  Colors, fonts, and [work-appropriate] images are up to you.  Feel free to use your completed submission as a portfolio piece!

Language requirements:
HTML.  Take advantage of semantic elements offered in HTML5 where applicable.
CSS or SCSS.  Styling must be done from scratch.  No external CSS libraries such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc. are allowed, with the exception of normalize.css or a comparable CSS reset.  Font Awesome or similar is also allowed for icons.
Try to use BEM for naming classes (http://getbem.com/naming/).
Use vanilla JavaScript or jQuery.

Functional requirements:
Must be responsive and function on desktop, mobile, and any resolution in-between.
The main page container must be centered and not exceed a max-width of 1240px.
The page must prominently feature a logo at the top (can be text styled with CSS), sidebar navigation, a banner image, social links, and of course the main encyclopedia content (text with multiple heading and paragraph elements, and images).
The sidebar navigation must feature expandable categories.  The categories must also be able to be linked (note that you're only tasked with building a single page, but the functionality of a linked expander must be present).
On mobile, the sidebar turns into an expandable menu accessed via a header, with its expandable categories remaining intact within.  This may be done as a separate element that is only visible on mobile, but is also possible to have the sidebar change to the header.  How to do it is up to you.
Interactive elements must include hover states and CSS transitions.
Sidebar items must feature an active class to indicate the current page.
Include images within the body text with appropriate, reusable classes to wrap text around them.

Deliverables:
Link to GitHub repository.
Link to project hosted on GitHub pages (https://pages.github.com/) or other hosting service.
Send links to your deliverables to (removed to protect privacy) (or just reply to this email) by August 12th.
Also here's a live example to see the functionality, but don't copy any code because a) I made that a long time ago and it's not using best practices and the class names are terrible, and b) I'll know.

Good luck!
